# Remember-Me
A CSE115A Project developed by Gareth Samadhana, Grant Fu, Sarah Liang, Gavril Tango, and Dillon Lee

Purpose: Helping people who struggle with Alzheimer's and memory loss by remembering their family and friends.

Motivation: Alzheimer’s is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that results in memory loss and other cognitive abilities serious enough to interfere with daily life. The disease is the 6th leading cause of death in the US, affecting more than 5 million Americans. In the absence of a cure for the illness, developing solutions to help Alzheimer’s patients to live better daily life  is increasingly pressing.

Intended Users: Patients with Alzheimer's
